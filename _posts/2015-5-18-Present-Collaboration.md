title: Present Collaboration
---

Project release this morning presented my group with the challenge to create an app to allow groups of people to collaboratively buy a present for a recipient, with the purchase being actioned on the last member of the group making the transaction.

##User Stories##
From the launch of the project we went straight into our first sprint planning meeting, initially our client was unavailable and hence we set about building user stories around what we knew about the project as a whole from it's initial launch at the Final Projects Jamboree.

##Client Meeting##

Mid Afternoon we were able to meet with Jordan, who is the client for the project and also happens to be the Marketing Director at [Makers Academy](www.makersacademy.com). Armed with a list of questions to further clarify

##Technologies##

I'll talk further tomorrow of the technology stack we are going to use as we have tried to be relatively agnostic towards this until we have a really good understanding of the problem we face

##Backlog##

We finally moved into loading our backlog with tasks split down from our MVP Roadmap assisted by our user stories. We decided to use Trello as it gave us an easily useable solution for a kanban board, for teams working remotley from each other, like us!
